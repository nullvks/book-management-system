# book-management-system
A simple CRUD spring-boot app with PostgreSQL integration

Question:
You have been tasked with developing a RESTful APl using Spring Boot for a book management system. The system should allow users to perform CRUD operations
on books stored in a database. You are required to implement the following functionalities:
1. Create a new book by providing its title, author, and publication year.
2. Retrieve a specific book by its unique ID.
3. Update the details of an existing book (title, author, or publication year).
4. Delete a book by its unique ID.
5. Retrieve a list of all books in the database.

Your task is to design and implement the necessary Spring Boot components to fulfill these requirements. Consider using Spring Data JPA for database interaction.

Write the necessary code to implement the RESTful API endpoints and the corresponding service and repository classes. You may assume that the database
configuration and connection are already set up.

Note: You can use any Java IDE or text editor to write the code, However, please provide the complete code for all necessary components to demonstrate your
solution.

Hint: Make sure to define the appropriate entity class for the book and annotate it properly for database mapping.
